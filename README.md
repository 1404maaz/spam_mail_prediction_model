# spam_mail_prediction_model

This repository contains a spam mail prediction model built on the Logistic Regression algorithm. The model classifies emails as either spam or ham (not spam) based on features analyzed from a dataset consisting of 5572 data points. The dataset is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing.

# Overview

The goal of this project is to create an effective spam mail classifier using Logistic Regression. Google Colab is utilized for development, and dependencies include NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
